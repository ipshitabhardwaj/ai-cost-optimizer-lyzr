## 🧠 Problem Statement

Enterprises often struggle with high and unpredictable cloud bills due to the lack of actionable, real-time insights. Traditional monitoring tools provide raw usage data but do not translate that into understandable and personalized optimization suggestions.

---

## 🌟 Solution

An AI-powered cost optimization advisor agent, built using **Lyzr Studio** and **Amazon Bedrock (Nova)**, that interacts with **AWS Cost APIs** to deliver:

- Conversational responses to cloud cost inquiries
- Personalized cost-saving recommendations
- Real-time usage analysis
- Human-like explanations tailored for both technical and non-technical users

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Lyzr.ai Studio** (Agent logic, prompt engineering)
- **Amazon Bedrock (Nova)** (LLM)
- **AWS Cost APIs** (Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor)
- **Python** (for backend integrations)
- *(Optional frontend planned for later)*

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User inputs a query such as _"Why are my EC2 costs high this month?"_
2. Agent fetches relevant cost metrics using AWS APIs
3. LLM (Nova) summarizes findings with optimization advice
4. User receives clear, actionable recommendations
